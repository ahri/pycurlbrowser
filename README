browser.Browser

    A minimal browser based on pycurl/lxml.

    Mechanize seemed a bit slow for my usage, so I wrote this alternative using
    pycurl (i.e. libcurl) and lxml, mostly focused on speed, whilst not
    compromising on the features I see as useful (cookies and form selection/
    POSTing).

    Plans:
        form support for radio, checkbox types
        decorator to catch errors and rethrow with attached browser data for
            easier scraper debugging

rest_client.RestClient

    A simple REST client based upon pycurlbrowser.

    CRUD approach providing:
        create
        read
        update
        destroy

rest_client.RestClientJson

    A REST client that only speaks JSON.

    Building upon RestClient to convert to/from JSON for a more streamlined
    experience taking in and returning Python primitives, using JSON as a
    transport protocol.
